Use the following format and structure based on existing causal-analysis notes:

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml

```

**Document Structure**:

**Sections** (use relevant ones):
- ## Summary or ## Overview
- ## Work Completed (if multiple tasks)
- ## Architecture / Implementation / Changes (technical details)
- ## Testing Performed (if applicable)

- ## Status / Next Steps / Conclusion

**Conventions**:
